We will then chart the evolution of this approach, beginning with its inspiration in Kantian metaphysics and earliest formulations by German romantics such as Schiller and proceeding on to freud and Ricoeur. A second strand begins with Hegel's theories of ""false consciousness"" that would in time develop into interpretations of myth as ideology , under the influence of Marx, Adorno, and Althusser.  A final strand begins with the early folklorists, the brothers Grimm, and would in time develop into functionalist approaches to myth by anthropologists such as Malinowski, Boas, and Levi-Strauss.
